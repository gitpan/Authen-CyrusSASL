To install the Authen::CyrusSASL Client module for Perl 5, proceed as follows :

1 Unpack the Authen-SASL source archive into a suitable directory with

	gunzip -cf Authen-SASL-x.xx.tar.gz |tar xvf -

2 Go into the newly created directory with

	cd Authen-SASL-x.xx

3 Build the module as usual :

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that for 'make test' to work, you should have a Sasl Authen/Pwcheck server running
with the IP address & secret of the target machine in its clients file. You
should also know a username & password in order to test if authentication
works OK. Doing a 'make test' will first ask you for each of these.
